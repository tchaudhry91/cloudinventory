## Setup

Most of the setup/build/test instructions are loaded in the Makefile.

### Testing

This is a special case. Most of the code in here is wrapping on top the cloud libraries and hence requires valid credentials to proceed.
If these are not available please use `make test-short` instead. 
These tests could use a lot of improvment and PRs on these are very welcome. The primary challenge comes from having availability of difference credentials and accounts.

## Features/Bugs

Please open an issue before working on a PR. This will help reduce duplicate effort!

Thank You
